# Prediction_Model_-Data_Science_Salaries
This repository contains a prediction model for data science salaries from 2020 to 2030. The model uses historical salary data and applies a machine learning algorithm to forecast future salary trends in the field of data science.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the prediction model is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing concerns. However, a sample dataset with anonymized salary information can be obtained from Kaggle.

The dataset contains the following columns:
1. <b>Year</b>: The year of the salary record.</br>
2. <b>Experience</b>: The number of years of experience of the data scientist.</br>
3. <b>Education</b>: The highest level of education completed by the data scientist.</br>
4. <b>Skills</b>: A comma-separated list of skills possessed by the data scientist.</br>
5. <b>Salary</b>: The annual salary of the data scientist.</br>

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the prediction model:
1. Python 3.7 or above</br>
2. NumPy</br>
3. Pandas</br>
4. Scikit-learn</br>

# Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/RahulPatil-Tech/Prediction_Model_-Data_Science_Salaries.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd prediction-model-salaries
```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```shell
jupyter notebook
```
5. Open the <b>_Prediction_Model.ipynb_</b> notebook in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train and evaluate the prediction model.

# Model Evaluation
The prediction model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R^2) score. The evaluation results are displayed in the notebook, along with visualizations of the predicted salary trends.

# Future Work
While this prediction model provides valuable insights into data science salary trends, there are several avenues for future improvement and exploration. Some potential areas of future work include:
1. Incorporating additional features such as job titles, specific industry sectors, and company size to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.</br>
2. Collecting and incorporating more recent salary data to improve the accuracy and relevance of the predictions.</br>
3. Exploring advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms, such as neural networks, to potentially achieve better predictive performance.</br>
